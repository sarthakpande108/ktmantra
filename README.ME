KT Mantra is an AI-powered Knowledge Transfer automation system designed to onboard new employees faster and more efficiently. It simplifies project KT by delivering contextual learning, interactive chat-based training, and document-driven Q&A.

🎯 Project Goal

To eliminate manual KT dependency and ensure new joiners can:

Understand project documentation in a structured way

Learn gradually with interactive question-answering

Ask doubts anytime like chatting with a mentor

🧠 What KT Mantra Does

KT Mantra acts as an AI Teacher:

1️⃣ User selects a Project Name in UI
2️⃣ System loads the respective documentation
3️⃣ The chatbot explains the content step-by-step
4️⃣ After each section, the bot checks understanding
5️⃣ Users can ask questions anytime
6️⃣ Bot only moves ahead once user confirms readiness

This ensures KT is smooth, structured, and interactive.
